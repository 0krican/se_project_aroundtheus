# Sprint 3: Around The U.S.

### Description & Tech Used

- This project is profile for a user on the website "Around the world" to showcase the places they have traveled too
  and photographed along their journey, Allowing them to share it with the world and other fellow Adventures!

- Techeneques used to make this site envoled alot of CSS code and making sure I was using Figma correctly to import
  all the photos that were needed for the project also made custom screen views for phones. And made sure to follow
  along the video recordings as much as I could and also used some outside research to find some missing answers.

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
